Higher Lower game

Basic program in python to have a program determine on its own how to play a game. A simple program designed to practice learning.
The game has the player draw a card, then answer if the next card will be higher or lower. This version assumes the first 
card goes back in the pile. The second card is drawn, determining if the player won or lost.

This program has the computer 'learn' the game. It runs through a number of cycles of the game, determining when the 'higher'
choice would have won that hand. Then, the computer plays the game using this data to win approximately 77% of the time.
